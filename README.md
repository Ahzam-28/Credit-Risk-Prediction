## 🎯 Project Overview

Lending institutions face a fundamental question every day: **"Will this applicant repay the loan?"**
Wrong decisions are costly — approving a bad loan leads to default losses, while denying a good loan loses revenue and customer goodwill.

This project builds a **binary classification model** that learns from historical loan applications and predicts loan approval status (`Y` = approved / repaid, `N` = denied / defaulted).

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Train a model to **predict loan approval status** based on applicant attributes.
- Identify the **key features** that drive the approval decision.
- Compare the performance of two interpretable classifiers — **Logistic Regression** vs **Decision Tree**.
- Evaluate performance using **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix**.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

jupyter
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook Task_2_Credit_Risk.ipynb
```

Then **Run All Cells** ( `Cell → Run All` ).
Make sure `loan_data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.

```

### Pipeline steps
1. **Load** the `loan_data.csv` file with pandas.
2. **Handle missing values** — categorical columns filled with the **mode**, numeric with the **median**.
3. **Explore the data** — distributions, target balance, key feature relationships.
4. **Encode categoricals** with `LabelEncoder` and split the data 80 / 20 (stratified on the target).
5. **Train two models**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree (`max_depth=5`).
6. **Evaluate** with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Highlights from the EDA section of the notebook:

- **Class imbalance:** approval rate ≈ **77 %** — the dataset is moderately imbalanced toward approvals.
- **Missing values** present in `Gender`, `Married`, `Dependents`, `Self_Employed`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, `Credit_History` — all imputed before modelling.
- **Credit history** stands out as the single strongest visual predictor — good-credit applicants are approved at a dramatically higher rate.
- **Property area** matters: *Semiurban* properties have the highest approval rate, *Rural* the lowest.
- **Income** alone is a surprisingly weak signal — many high-income applicants are denied if other criteria fail.

Visualisations included:
- Bar chart of missing values
- Target distribution (`Loan_Status`)
- Loan amount distribution + box plot by status
- `Education` vs `Loan_Status` count plot
- `ApplicantIncome` box plot by status
- `Credit_History` vs `Loan_Status` count plot
- `Property_Area` vs `Loan_Status` count plot

## 🧠 Modelling

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Encoding | `LabelEncoder` on every categorical column |
| Split | `train_test_split(test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)` |
| Model 1 | `LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)` |
| Model 2 | `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)` |
| Metrics | `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, `classification_report` |

---

## 🏆 Results

| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| **Logistic Regression** | **≈ 0.87** | Linear, highly interpretable via coefficients |
| **Decision Tree (depth 5)** | **≈ 0.87** | Captures non-linear splits, easy to visualise |

> Both models score similarly because *Credit_History* is so dominant that even a simple linear boundary captures most of the signal.

### Confusion matrix interpretation

|  | Predicted N | Predicted Y |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual N** | True Negatives | False Positives ❗ (risky — bad loans approved) |
| **Actual Y** | False Negatives (lost revenue) | True Positives |

The notebook prints the classification report (precision, recall, F1) for both classes so you can inspect the trade-off directly.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **`Credit_History` is the dominant predictor.** Applicants with good credit history are approved overwhelmingly more often — this is the single most important variable for the lender.
2. **`Property_Area = Semiurban`** has the highest approval rate, *Rural* the lowest.
3. **Income alone is a weak predictor** — combining it with `LoanAmount` (debt-to-income) is more informative.
4. **Education** has only a small marginal effect once other variables are controlled for.
5. The dataset's class imbalance (~77 % approvals) means **accuracy alone is not sufficient** — recall on the **denied** class is the more business-critical metric.
